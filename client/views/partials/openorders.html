<!-- 
I have not figured out why I need to refer to openOrders using the $parent scope. 
Perhaps my understanding of $scope is limited; I have to push to the openOrders array using 
$parent, and refer to it here using $parent otherwise the array is empty

<div ng-controller="tickerCtrl">
  <div ui-grid="{ data: $parent.openOrders }" class="grid">{{$parent.openOrders}}</div>
